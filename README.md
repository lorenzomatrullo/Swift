# Swift

On macOS, open any `.playground` directly in Xcode (or open `swift.xcworkspace`). Each topic below links to a playground with focused examples.

## Learning Path

1. Basics
- [Variables and Constants (Type Annotation)](libs/variables_typeAnnotation.playground)
- [Booleans](libs/booleans.playground)
- [Strings](libs/strings.playground)

2. Operators and Expressions
- [Math Operators and Number Formatting](libs/math_operators_formatting.playground)
- [Logical Operators](libs/logical_operators.playground)
- [Ternary Operator](libs/ternary_operators.playground)
- [Type Casting](libs/type_casting.playground)

3. Control Flow
- [If–Else Statements](libs/if-else_statements.playground)
- [Switch Statements](libs/switch_statements.playground)
- [For-In Loops](libs/for_loops.playground)
- [While and Repeat-While Loops](libs/while_loops.playground)

4. Collections and Strings
- [Arrays](libs/arrays.playground)
- [Dictionaries](libs/dictionaries.playground)
- [Strings (Manipulation and Interpolation)](libs/strings.playground)

5. Functions
- [Functions (Parameters and Labels)](libs/functions.playground)
- [Return Statements](libs/return_statements.playground)

6. Optionals
- [Optionals](libs/optionals.playground)

7. User-Defined Types and Language Features
- [Structs](libs/structs.playground)
- [Mutating Methods on Structs](libs/structs_mutatingMethods.playground)
- [Property Observers](libs/property_observers.playground)
- [Initializers](libs/initializers.playground)
- [Classes](libs/classes.playground)
- [Inheritance](libs/classes_inheritance.playground)
- [Method/Property Overrides](libs/classes_override.playground)

8. Sandboxes
- [Test / Scratchpad](libs/test.playground)

## Tips
- You can run code snippets directly inside each playground’s `Contents.swift`.
- Explore variations: change values, add print statements, and experiment.
- If you prefer a workspace, open `swift.xcworkspace` to keep multiple playgrounds handy.
